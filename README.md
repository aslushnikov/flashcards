# Flashcards, simple, minimalistic & opionated.

## Motivation

I spend oh-so-many-time trying to find a flashcards *service* that would fit my needs:
- must be fast
- simple and minimalistic interface
- no banner ads, ideally no ads at all
- mobile friendly
- export & import functionality so that I won't be tied to it forever
- works offline in training mode on my iphone

I didn't find one. The project is my highly-opionated implementation of these
principals.

## Status

App works nicely on iOS7, Android4.4 and modern desktop browsers.

The following is implemented:
- basic functionality to add, remove, edit & tag words
- import & export
- train different subsets of words (by tags, by date); works offline as far as you load training
