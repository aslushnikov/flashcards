# Flashcards, simple

That's what it looks like on my iPhone

## Motivation

I spend oh-so-many-time trying to find a flashcards *service* that would fit my needs:
- must be fast
- simple interface with a bare minimum of buttons
- no banner ads, ideally no ads at all
- mobile friendly
- export & import functionality so that I won't be tied to it forever
- works offline in training mode on my iphone

I didn't find one. The project is a highly-opionated implementation of a flashcards service that sticks to these principals.

## Status

App works nicely on iOS7, Android4.4 and modern desktop browsers. I use it on a day-to-day basis
and all the must-have things are implemented

- basic functionality to add, remove, edit & tag words
- import & export
- train different subsets of words (by tags, by date); works offline as far as you load training page

## Future work

- "Remove word" functionality is **impossible** to find (long tap on a word) - figure out a better aproach
- Its getting harder and harder to train words as its count grows - no way to filter out words that I'm already good at
